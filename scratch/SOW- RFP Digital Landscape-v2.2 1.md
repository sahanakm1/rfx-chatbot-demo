1.Background

The eventual scope of this RfP is overhauling JTI’s digital landscape, which is comprised of our current corporate website at the core, complemented by microsites such as the career platform, science communication website and other smaller websites (see 4.d.). Over the years, add-ons and ad hoc updates have been pushed to serve various agendas. This resulted in creating a disjointed digital ecosystem, which is no longer in line with our corporate messaging.

Both content and branding on our website and the greater digital landscape must be aligned with the new corporate purpose (due early May) and the new corporate brand (due this summer, and in the meantime, [current branding guidelines available here](https:\www.jtibrand.com\login) ). We hope to receive a proposal that articulates the vision of an ideal digital landscape – offering engaging content with appealing visuals for our various audiences.

In the last couple of years, prework for jti.com revamp has been conducted. Your proposal should consider the insights gained from the prework: Audience missions, JTI Corporate Digital Ecosystem Discovery Summary and Next Steps, JTI Metrio &amp; Sustainability Content Issues Summary. Please see attached in the folder “Annex Global Comms.zip.”

Our priority is the revamp of jti.com which was launched roughly 6 years ago. Corporate Communications is the owner of the corporate website and responsible for our external communications channels; however, we have other stakeholders and content owners such as colleagues from People &amp; Culture (HR), Science communications, Sustainability, as well as our parent company JT. Each team is an integral part of our digital landscape and must work closely together either as an owner of a site or stakeholder.

2. Objectives of our corporate website

It should serve as JTI’s shop window to the world as well as a bridge to our social media presence and other satellite websites. It is one of our main communications channels where we can tell our stories in depth without constraints.

Note:

- New branding to be launched in Q3
- Limited product/brand information disclosure due to legal age requirements
