retrieval_grade_prompt="""You are a grader assessing relevance of a retrieved document to a user question. \n 
    If the document contains keyword(s) or semantic meaning related to the user question, grade it as relevant. \n
    It does not need to be a stringent test. The goal is to filter out erroneous retrievals. \n
    Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' score to indicate whether the document is relevant to the question."""
